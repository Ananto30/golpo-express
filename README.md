# Golpo Express

This is the express backend of the current [golpo project](https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo). Site - [golpo.dedsec.life](http://golpo.dedsec.life/)

But there are things we are changing from the current Golpo. We will use Golpo as a link sharing platform. And it will be free for eveyone! Future plan involves link management (collection of links and sorting) and sharing collection.

So here is our plan -

## Change plan

### Backend

*   Verify post is only a link.
*   Extract meta data from link and save them in the database.
*   Do not allow to share the same link in 24 hours.
*   Add like count and people who liked the post.
*   Add follow functionality.

### Frontend

*   Convert from React to Svelte.
*   Separate page for chats and user chat. (Chats are list of users who I have chat with in the past and UserChat is a single user chatting interface)
*   Profile edit page or modal.
*   Send message to user button and modal.

## Run the project

Run docker for mongodb -

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Set env variables -

```
set -o allexport; source .env; set +o allexport;
```

(*see config.js for all env variables*)

Run the server -

```
npm install
npm start
```

To get some demo data run this -

```
npm run bootstrap
```
